                         Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany on March 14, 1879. His parents were Erman Einstein and Paula Koch. Albert was the first child in the family and had a sister, Maya, who was born in 1881.
                         <br><br>
                         His father was an engineer and entrepreneur, and his mother was a musically talented woman. As a child, Albert displayed high intelligence and curiosity, but showed little interest in formal education.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1894, when Albert was 15, his family moved to Italy and then to Switzerland, where he entered the federal technical school in Zurich. In 1900 he finished school and received Swiss citizenship.
                         <br><br>
                         After leaving school, Albert Einstein worked in the Swiss patent office, where he studied and patented inventions. However, his real passion was in science and he began to work on his theory of relativity. In 1905 he published his famous article "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", which became the basis for his theory of relativity.

He was a very curious child and constantly asked questions. In 1894, when he was 15, his family moved to Italy, where Albert continued his studies. In Italy, he began to be interested in mathematics and physics, and already then showed his talent for scientific research.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1896, Albert Einstein returned to Switzerland and entered the Zurich Polytechnic Institute, where he began to study physics and mathematics. During this period, he delved into the study of science and began to publish his first scientific articles.
                         <br><br>
                         After graduating from university, Albert Einstein worked in the Swiss patent office, but still continued his scientific research. In 1905 he published his famous article "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", which became the basis for his theory of relativity and brought him fame and recognition in the scientific world.

                         Albert Einstein became famous for his scientific research and theories that revolutionized physics and cosmology. His best known theory is the theory of relativity, which describes how space and time are related to each other and how they interact with matter and energy.
                         <br><br>
                         This theory formed a new way of looking at the physical world, and it was experimentally confirmed within a few years after its publication. As a result, Einstein became one of the most respected scientists in the world.
                         <br><br>
                         He was the recipient of many prizes and awards, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for explaining the effect of the photoelectric phenomenon, which also brought about revolutionary changes in physics. He was also chairman of the International Institute of Physics for Theoretical Research, where he spent many years of his life.
                         <br><br>
                         Einstein became a symbol of science and intellectualism, and his name became famous all over the world. He became an icon of the 20th century and is still one of the most influential scientists in the history of science.

                         Albert Einstein left a great legacy in science and culture. His theory of relativity became the foundation of modern physics and led to the development of many other scientific and technological branches, including atomic energy, cosmology, and theoretical physics.
                         <br><br>
                         In addition, he made a great contribution to the philosophy of science, drawing attention to the problem of the relativity of knowledge and the existence of different points of view. His work on the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and cosmology is still used in scientific research and engineering projects.
                         <br><br>
                         In addition to his scientific achievements, Einstein is also known for his social and political views. He was an activist for peace and nuclear disarmament, protested against nationalism and racism, and campaigned for freedom and democracy. His letter to President Roosevelt about the creation of a nuclear bomb became a landmark moment in the history of science and politics.
                         <br><br>
                         Today, the legacy of Albert Einstein continues to influence science, philosophy and culture around the world. His name has become synonymous with intelligence and genius, and his scientific theories and social views remain relevant and important in our modern life.</p>

                         Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955 in Prine Plains, New York, USA at the age of 76. His death was caused by internal bleeding associated with a ruptured aortic aneurysm.
                         <br><br>
                         After his death, the body was cremated and the ashes were scattered in an unknown location in accordance with his wishes. During his lifetime, he expressed a wish that his body would not become an object of veneration or monument. Instead, he wanted people to remember him for his scientific achievements and the ideas he left as a legacy to mankind.
                         <br><br>
                         The death of Albert Einstein caused great regret throughout the world. He was respected and loved for his genius, contributions to science and philosophy, and for his social and political views. Today, he remains one of the most respected and influential scientists in the history of science.</p>
