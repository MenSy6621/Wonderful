                         Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856 in Smilan, a small town in Croatia (on the territory of modern Croatia, but then it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). His parents were Serbs, his father was Milutin Tesla, a priest in the Orthodox Church, and his mother was Juka Mandic, a housewife.
                         <br><br>
                         Nikola Tesla was the fourth child in the family, he had five brothers and sisters. From an early age, Tesla showed extraordinary ability and interest in science, and especially in electricity. In his memoirs, he said that as a child he saw in a dream bright lightning flashes that flashed before his eyes, and this had a great influence on him.

                    <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 10px; width: 100px;"> Nikola Tesla began his career with the Telephone Factory in Budapest, where he engaged in the development of telephone equipment and other electrical devices. In 1882 he moved to Paris, where he worked for the Continental Edison Company, a division of the Thomas Edison Company. During this period, Tesla studied the theory and practice of electrical engineering and began to work on his own ideas.
                    <br><br>
                     In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he began working in the laboratory of Thomas Edison. However, their cooperation was short-lived, as Tesla and Edison could not agree on various issues related to the work on projects. In 1887, Tesla founded his own company, the Tesla Electric Company, and began work on various projects in the field of electrical engineering.

                    Over the next few years, Nikola Tesla developed several important inventions, including the AC system, the electrical transformer, the AC electric motor, and the wireless communication system. He also studied electromagnetic waves and various phenomena related to electricity. His inventions and ideas were of great importance for the development of electrical engineering and modern electric power industry.

                            Nikola Tesla is one of the most famous scientists and inventors in the history of science and technology. His inventions and ideas were of great importance for the development of electrical engineering and modern electric power industry.
                            <br><br>
                            One of Tesla's most famous inventions is the alternating current system, which he developed in the late 1880s. This system became the basis of modern electric power industry and allowed the transmission of electrical energy over long distances, which led to the emergence of centralized power grids.
                            <br><br>
                            Tesla also invented the electrical transformer, which made it possible to increase the voltage of electrical energy and thereby increase the transmission distance of electricity. He developed the AC electric motor, which became the basis of the industrial production line and is currently used in many fields, including transportation and manufacturing.
                            <br><br>
                            However, despite the importance of his inventions and ideas, Tesla was not well recognized in his day. He died in relative poverty in 1943, and it was not until many years after his death that his contribution to the development of science and technology received due recognition.
                            <br><br>
                            Today, the name of Nikola Tesla has become a symbol of genius and innovation, and his scientific and technical achievements have become an inspiration for many scientists and engineers around the world.

                      Nikola Tesla left a huge legacy in science and technology. His inventions and ideas in the field of electrical engineering and electric power industry significantly changed the world and influenced many areas of science and technology, including radio, television, computers, telephony and others.
                      <br><br>
                      One of Tesla's most famous legacies is the alternating current system, which became the basis for the modern electric power industry. He also invented many other devices such as AC electric motors, electrical transformers, radio control systems, and more.
                      <br><br>
                      Tesla also studied the phenomena associated with the high frequency electromagnetic field and developed the concept of wireless power transmission. Although this technology has not yet been fully realized, Tesla's ideas in this area are still relevant and inspire researchers around the world.
                      <br><br>
                      Tesla's important legacy is also his philosophy of science and technology, which believed that the goal of science is to create devices that can be useful to mankind and at the same time do not harm the environment. He also actively explored the possibilities of using solar, wind and other renewable energy sources long before these technologies became widespread.
                      <br><br>
                      Overall, Nikola Tesla's legacy remains important to modern science and technology, and his ideas and inventions continue to inspire scientists and engineers around the world.</p>
