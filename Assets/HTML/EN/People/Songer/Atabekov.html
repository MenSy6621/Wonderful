                    <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-right: 10px;" data-aos="zoom-in-left"> The singer was born on August 11, 1986 in John-Aryk, a village in the Talas region of the Kyrgyz Republic. He was only 2 years old when the head of the family, Boobek Atabekov, died in a traffic accident. Datkayym Atabekova, left without material support and moral support, single-handedly raised Mirbek, his half-brother Nurbek and half-sister Nurayym.
                    <br><br>
                    In Kyrgyzstan, it is not accepted that the place at the head of the family is empty, so Mirbek matured early. As a teenager, he learned how to slaughter sheep, make a fire, fix plumbing and electrical wiring in a businesslike way.
                    <br><br>
                    However, creativity has always lived inside him. With this, Atabekov went to his father - he loved and knew how to sing, which earned him respect in John-Aryk. Already at the age of 25, he headed the Department of Culture of the Talas region. In 2010, the local House of Culture was named after a man who passed away untimely.
                    <br><br>
                    Until the 6th grade, Mirbek studied at the John-Aryk school, then his family moved to the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, Bishkek. The boy studied well, but without much enthusiasm, he was much more interested in creativity. From an early age, he sang at amateur performances and holidays.
                    <br><br>
                    Already from the 9th grade, Atabekov performed in cafeterias and restaurants. He did not leave the stage even when he entered the Faculty of Economics of the Bishkek State University. K. Karaseva. For many years, the singer perceived his performances as a hobby, but it was they who brought the main income to the family. Getting to the final of the TV show "Singing City" on OTRK opened the guy's eyes - he can become a professional artist.</p>

                    <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 10px;"> Mirbek Atabekov was the most enviable bachelor of the Kyrgyz Republic, but in 2014 he married his beloved Meerim Tolpbergen. On the eve of the celebration, the singer gave several interviews and admitted that it was easy to say goodbye to freedom:</p>
                    <p class="oop">"When a man loves, he wants to be close to his beloved. His goal is to start a family, and everything else seems unimportant.‚Äù </p>
                        <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 10px;">Mirbeck proposed romantically on the red steps of Times Square in New York. When passers-by realized that they had witnessed a solemn event, they began to applaud and congratulate.</p>
                        <p class="oop">"This will be remembered for a lifetime," the singer does not hide his emotions.</p>
                        <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 10px;"> In a dialogue with Evening Bishkek, Mirbek Atabekov taught men several lessons. He noted that you should not be shy about confessing your love to your chosen ones, but it is also important not to overdo it. And underlined:</p>
                        <p class="oop">"The foundation of a strong relationship is mutual respect, understanding, and a desire to hear each other."
                        The wedding of Mirbek and Meerim dragged on for several months. In December 2013, the newlyweds went through the folk rite kyz uzatuu, or seeing off the bride. The official celebration and painting took place only in the spring of 2014: until that moment, the singer was busy filming the musical comedy "Tumar, or Become a Star" (2014). <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 10px;">Atabekov once said in an interview:</p>
                        <p class="oop">I want my children to grow up in the countryside because there is a big difference between villagers and city dwellers. Children who are brought up far from civilization are strong and hardy, while children from cities are strong-willed, impatient and sensitive.‚Äù</p>
                        <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 10px;"> The singer's wishes were not destined to come true - all his children grow up in the USA, in the center of New York. However, they retained their Kyrgyz nationality.

                <h5 class="" style="padding-left:500px; margin-top: 30px;" data-aos="zoom-in-left">Music</h5>
                 <div class="py-vh-1 pb-0 pl-5 col-12 col-lg-10 col-xl-8 d-flex justify-content-center" data-aos="zoom-in-left">
                     <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-right: 10px;">In 2004, Mirbek Atabekov radically changed his biography, finally focusing on creativity. He joined the Sanat group, but quickly realized that he saw himself as an exclusively solo artist. Talent was enough to win over the audience - the first song "Seni Gana" became a hit.
                         <br><br>
                         When writing Seni Gan, Mirbek was inspired by Sting's Enlishman in New Your, as the singer admitted in an interview. True, we had to nationalize the motive a little: in those years, in the Kyrgyz Republic, they were skeptical about "non-native" music.<br><br>
                         Popularity increased like a snowball. Each song of Atabekov became a hit. He performed at major national holidays, at toi (a feast among the Turkic peoples), gave concerts at festivals in Central Asia. On the wave of success, the singer starred in the romantic comedy The Talisman (2014).
                         <br><br>
                         Mirbek Atabekov's track record includes not only solo compositions, but also successful duets, for example, "Eki Zhurok" with Shahzoda or "Tynda Meni" with Kamshat Zholdybayeva.
                         <br><br>
                         When writing material, the artist does not get hung up on a particular genre. He is equally close to folk, pop music, classic rock. The singer is used to being inspired by something: if he liked a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù song, then with a high probability his next composition will also become ‚Äúheavy‚Äù.
                         <br><br>
                         Perhaps that is why Mirbeck does not have a single album on his account: it is difficult to combine compositions so disparate in genre into a collection. True, who knows, maybe the artist plans to release a solo album after all.
                     </p>

                     <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 30px;"> In July 2020, the film ‚ÄúMeken‚Äù premiered on YouTube, which means ‚ÄúMotherland‚Äù in Russian . Mirbek Atabekov applied his talent to him. <br><br>
                     The patriotic painting was at the center of a scandal a year earlier. The Ministry of Culture of the Kyrgyz Republic refused to let it into the cinema because of the scenes of corruption. But, even when the film did manage to screen on independent platforms, reviews were mixed. Some noted a weak acting game, others - a lack of reliability.
                     <br><br>
                     As for Mirbek's musical plans, they remain a mystery. It is known that in the summer of 2020 he was working on material, but what exactly it will be - a song or an album, is not yet known.
