This is a typical Russian outback, built up with dull houses of the same type, whose residents work at local city-forming enterprises. Ivan's family was no exception: his grandfather was an engineer at an auto-mechanical plant, his mother worked at a chemical plant.
                    <br><br>
                    Ivan inherited his creative abilities from his musician father, who left the family when his son was barely nine years old. The divorce of the parents was a great shock to the fragile child psyche. The boy reflected his experiences in poetry, which he began to write at such a young age.

                    <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 10px; width: 100px;"> . After 2 years, Alekseev got a place as a bass player and backing vocalist in the Levers of Machines ensemble. But Ivan was more and more interested in rap, and the young man tried to write his first compositions on his own.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2001, Alekseev graduated from a music school and became a member of the Belgorod hip-hop group V.I.P. together with a friend Arkady. For creativity, the young men took pseudonyms: they began to recognize Ivan under the name Noize MC, a classmate chose the nickname Adik 228. During the year, young people created the Face2Face rap duet, which included performing at various venues in the region, and also traveled to neighboring countries.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2002, Alekseev graduated from high school with a gold medal and entered the Faculty of Modern Technologies of the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow, where he planned to get a higher education. At the end of the first year, Ivan assembled the Protivo Gunz musical ensemble from the students of the RSUH dormitory.
                        <br><br>
                        In his youth, the rapper performed solo at hip-hop festivals, competitions and freestyle battles, where he often won. In the spring of 2005, Noize MC's circle of fans expanded after his victory over MC Molodoy in a Snickers Guru Klan street fight.

                  At the Snickers Urbania festival, the musician had the honor to work as a jury member and presenter. After graduating from the 3rd year, Ivan Alekseev moved to the Old Arbat area. In a rented room, the rapper kept all the equipment of the group and in his free time arranged street performances with the musicians of Protivo Gunz, experimenting with genres and forms of musical compositions.
                  <br><br>
                  During the year, Ivan continued to travel around the country with concerts of the Protivo Gunz group and accumulate material for solo work, which allowed the musician to sign a contract with the Respect Production label in mid-2006. Having won the Urban Sound competition, Ivan Alekseev got the opportunity to shoot a video for the song "Song for Radio", which was included in the rotation of the Muz-TV channel.</p>
                 
              <h5 class="" style="padding-left:360px; margin-top: 30px;" data-aos="zoom-in-left">World famous</h5>

                  <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-right: 10px;">In 2007, the musician and Respect Production signed a contract with the Russian division of Universal Music Group, which was regarded by rap fans as an unprecedented event . In the same year, Alekseev became the winner of a major Internet battle of Russian-speaking rappers, and the song "Behind the Closed Door" entered the top ten of the "MTV 100 Best Songs - 2007" rating.
                      <br><br>
                      In the late spring of 2008, Alekseev announced his departure from Universal Music and released his first album, The Greatest Hits vol. 1, which included 20 tracks, including "Behind the Closed Door", "From the Window", "Kantemirovskaya", "Skinhead Girl". In 2009, Noise was awarded the A-One RAMP TV channel awards in the Runet Respect nomination and Steppenwolf in the Lyrics nomination.
                      <br><br>
                      At the end of May 2010, in the Moscow club "B1 Maximum", the presentation of the second Noize MC disc "The Last Album" took place, which included the musical compositions "Arrange Destroy", "Red October". Fans were interested not only in the disc, but also in the book of the same name, written by the band member Pasha Teterin, as well as the role-playing audio book Underground, created on the plot of the drummer's work.
                      <br><br>
                      Noize MC received awards from the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper, the Muz-TV channel, the Silver Rain radio, the InDaRnB.ru portal and Artemy Troitsky's Stepnoy Volk award. In 2010, the singer was ranked 41st in the Forbes rating in the Stars and Money section. According to analysts, the rapper earned $900,000 in 2009.

                  The musician did not slow down and a year later presented the fans with the "New Album", the release of which was preceded by the premiere of a number of songs. After a while, the Protivo Gunz group celebrated the 10th anniversary of their creative activity with the release of two albums - the eponymous album, for the song from which a video clip was shot, and the disc Confusion. The venue of the Moscow KZ Stadium Live was chosen for the team's anniversary concert, and the MTV channel was broadcasting.
                  <br><br>
                  Noize MC's discography was replenished with the sixth album Hard Reboot in 2014. Many tracks for him were created in collaboration with other performers: "Jordan" feat. Atlantida Project, "abv&eyuya" together with the poetess Vera Polozkova, Ne2Da? co-authored with Mewark. In addition, the album includes solo compositions by Noize MC, authored by musician Alexander Petrunin. At the same time, Ivan Alekseev played the role of a drug dealer in a 3D production of the musical Romeo and Juliet, which took place in the 22nd century.
                  <br><br>
                  2015 began for the artist with a performance at the Barents Spektakel international music festival in Norway. In mid-March, clubs A2 (St. Petersburg) and Stadium Live (Moscow) hosted 2 Noize MC solo concerts dedicated to his 30th birthday. The rapper presented on the YouTube channel the first Russian-language clip Yes Future!, filmed using the 360-degree technique. Later, the premiere of the single Make Some Noise, accompanied by an orchestra, took place at concert venues in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
                  <br><br>
                  In October, the singer prepared the musical composition "Save My Speech", which was included in the biographical film about Osip Mandelstam "Save My Speech Forever". In mid-November, Noize MC received the main Music Box - 2015 award in the "Hip-Hop of the Year" nomination at the awards ceremony held at the State Kremlin Palace.
                  <br><br>
                  In 2016, the artist presented the seventh album "King of the Hill", which included the tracks "Petersburg Roofs", "Favorite Color". In addition, the musician expanded the boundaries of the genre by writing to the hip-hoper "ΘΡΦΣЫ & ЭΒΡИΔИΚΑ". Yuri Kvyatkovsky staged it on stage.
                  <br><br>
                  Later, the singer began preparing the next album, writing new musical material. At the hip-hop festival, which took place on May 1 at Luzhniki, Noize MC presented the song "Marathon".
                  <br><br>
                  The artist took on a frightening look in the Anacondaz team's video for the song "Let Them Die". The video was created with many film effects and animation, and the artists themselves appeared in the images of horror movie characters.
                  <br><br>
                  In 2020, the musician continued to engage in creativity, but not in the format in which he planned. In the spring, the coronavirus did not allow Noize MC to give concerts, and the performer spent this time with his family. As the rapper admitted in an interview, this was the first time in his musical career when he stayed at home for 4 months and was finally able to fully enjoy the role of a loving husband and father. In the summer, the artist released a new track “Katatsumuri” with Linda, based on a haiku quote from the Japanese poet Kobayashi Issa.
                  <br><br>
                  At the same time, the fans heard another creation of Alekseev - the track "Let's Run Away", dedicated to Yegor Creed and Loc-Dog. At the end of September, the singer presented the fans with a video for the song "League of Legends", inspired by the game League of Legends. The artist, speaking about the track, said that the center of the composition is a story about how a person tries to break out of the vicious circle of poverty and hopelessness, finds the strength to go through life's difficulties.
                  <br><br>
                  In October, the public heard a new collaboration between Noize MC and Monetochka. The performers released a video for the song "Live without a trace", in which they discussed the problem of overconsumption. In the video, the duet appeared before the fans in the images of used dolls, which the young hostess threw in the trash, having received new ones as a gift.</p>

                      <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 30px;"> Noize MC opposes the excessive enrichment of the oligarchs, in his statements and a number of songs he criticizes the image of Russian capitalism. Together with colleagues from the groups "Cockroaches!" and "Lyapis Trubetskoy" he released several compositions on topical topics. The artist's repertoire also includes anti-fascist tracks.
                          <br><br>
                          In his hits, the musician denounces corruption in government. So, in the Bring Me Your Money video (“Give me your money”), the singer acted as a Russian policeman collecting bribes. Later, after delivering a speech in support of the Ukrainian people, the rapper faced restrictions on his concert activity.
                          <br><br>
                          In 2010, the musician created the song "Mercedes S666", which drew attention to the high-profile case of an accident that occurred through the fault of Lukoil Vice President Anatoly Barkov. After the scandalous clip, the older generation of listeners also became interested in the artist's creative biography. At concerts, the musician often behaved provocatively, which ultimately led to an arrest for 10 days for hooliganism.</p>

                  <p class="text-secondary" style="width: 1000px; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px;" data-aos="zoom-in-left">
                        In August 2018, Noize MC participated in the Invasion festival. Here the singer performed the song "People with Machine Guns", endowed with an anti-militarist message, while noting that he was looking forward to those times when the armed forces would lose their relevance.</p>

                      <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-right: 10px;"> At the beginning of 2022, the rapper left Russia. Now the musician calls Lithuania his home and admits that he fell in love with Vilnius with all his heart. There he continued his work, writing and filming several videos, including the song "Land of Rains". And for the fall and winter he announced a big Euro-American tour with the program "Everything is like with people."
                          <br><br>
                          About his political position, in which the condemnation of the SVO was traced, Noize MC gave a detailed interview to Dud. In addition to this agenda, the singer spoke about the unexpected reaction for him to the album “Exit to the City”, after which they began to say about him that he “scribbled”. Alexei did not understand why his audience had such a reaction, since he invested a lot of resources in the disc.
                          <br><br>
                          In November, Noize MC was entered by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation into the register of foreign agents.</p>
