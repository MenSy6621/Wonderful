Ybrai lost his father early, and was brought up by his grandfather, the famous biy Balgozhi Zhanburshin.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1850, Balgozha-bi assigned Ibrai to a boarding school under the Orenburg Border Commission. Altynsarin successfully graduated from it in 1857 and for three years worked as a clerk for his grandfather Balgozhi, the manager of the Uzun clan of the Kipchak tribe, the military foreman of the Orenburg Commission.</p>

                    While studying at school, he independently studied the works of the classics of world literature - Shakespeare, Goethe, Byron, Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, Firdousi, Nizami, Navoi, etc. He talked with the later famous orientalist V. Grigoriev, who served in the Border Commission. He often visited the house of V. Grigoriev, used his library.
                    <br><br>
                    After leaving school for about 3 years (1857 - 1860) he worked as a clerk for his grandfather, and then in the Orenburg government as a translator.

In 1860, the regional government instructed him to open an elementary school for Kazakh children in the Orenburg fortification (Turgai), in which he was appointed teacher of the Russian language. It was not easy to open a school in a remote town: there were no funds, there was no support from the regional government and local authorities. However, the difficulties did not stop Altynsarin. On January 8, 1864, the grand opening of the school took place. Thus began the educational activities of Altynsarin. For some time, I. Altynsarin worked in the Turgai district administration as a clerk, served as a senior assistant to the district head, and temporarily as a district judge.
                      <br><br>
                       In 1879, Altynsarin was appointed to the post of inspector of schools in the Turgai region. In this position, I. Altynsarin worked until the end of his life.
                      <br><br>
                       In 1883, Altynsarin moved to the Nikolaevsky (Kostanay) district. In his native place in the Arakaragay volost, three kilometers from the city of Kustanay, on the bend of the Tobol River, on an island where there was a small lake, which later received the name "Inspector", he built a house where he lived and worked until his death.</p>

                    <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-right: 10px; margin: 0;">Altynsarin’s outstanding historical merit lies in the fact that on his initiative, with his very direct participation, in Kazakhstan, a network of public secular schools. During his lifetime, he managed to open four two-class central Russian-Kyrgyz schools, one vocational school, one women's school, five volost schools, two schools for the children of Russian villagers.
                        <br><br>
                        The schools created by Altynsarin continued to exist after his death, but they could not develop. A new village in the history of I. Altynsarin's schools opened after the victory of October: they were transformed into Soviet labor schools. One of these schools in the homeland of I. Altynsarin, in the city of Kustanai, in the 20s </p>

Then, before the Great Patriotic War, it was transformed into a secondary school with a boarding house for pupils. It was named after its founder Ibray Altynsarin.
                    <br><br>
                    I. Altynsarin put a lot of work into the training of teachers for primary public schools in the region, primarily from the Kazakhs. On his initiative, a teacher's school was opened in the city of Troitsk, a little later transferred to the city of Orenburg.
                    <br><br>
                    Altynsarin not only opened secular folk schools, but also developed didactic principles for teaching and educating children for them, created educational and methodological manuals, regularly carried out inspection supervision, visiting each school annually, and took care of creating a library at each school.
                    <br><br>
                    I. Altynsarin spent about three years developing the Kazakh alphabet based on Russian graphics. Even before his appointment as an inspector of schools in the Turgai region, Altynsarin began compiling textbooks for students in Russian-Kazakh schools. In 1879, two textbooks "Kyrgyz Reader", "Initial Guide to Teaching the Kirghiz Russian Language" were published. Both books by I. Altynsarin occupy a special place in the history of the culture of Kazakhstan as monuments of written literature, as well as textbooks built on a scientific principle.
                    <br><br>
                    The journalistic heritage of Ibray Altynsarin is of great artistic, historical and educational value. The main part of it is the correspondence of the Kazakh educator with Russian friends, teachers and representatives of public education of various ranks.
                    <br><br>
                    I. Altynsarin also acted as a scientist - an ethnographer. In his essays, the conservative essence of the patriarchal-feudal life and customs of the Kazakhs is revealed. Particularly noteworthy are the works of I Altynsarin, devoted to the transformation of the socio-economic system and the economic life of the Kazakh aul.</p>
