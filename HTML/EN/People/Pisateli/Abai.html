                     <br><br>
                         Oskembay's son, Kunanbay, was born in 1804 and occupied an even higher position in society. He was appointed to the post of senior sultan of the Karkaraly outer district. He lived a long life, died in 1886, at the age of 82.
                         <br><br>
                         Abai's mother's name was Ulzhan, she belonged to the Karakesek family from the Argyn tribe.
                         <br><br>
                         As mentioned earlier, the boy was raised by his grandmother Zere, and it was she who played a key role in his life. It was she who came up with his nickname, by which the whole world knows him. It was she who taught him his native language, while his father really wanted the boy to be taught the knowledge of the Russian language first of all.
                         <br><br>
                         Ibragim Kunanbaev was born on August 10, 1845 in the Zhidebay tract of the Chingiz volost of the Semipalatinsk district of East Kazakhstan. At first, the boy was educated by a local mullah, but when he was 9 years old, he was sent to the city of Semipalatinsk, where he was assigned to a madrasah. There he is actively engaged in the study of Arabic and Persian languages. At the same time, the boy is studying at a Russian school, along with the children of the military and officials who served in Kazakhstan. After graduation, the boy tried his hand at poetry - he writes the first poems, although he tries to hide his authorship.

                     <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 10px;"> When Abai was still a thirteen-year-old boy, his father tried to accustom him to the duties that the head of the family performs. Abay continued this activity for 15 years, but by the age of 28 he moved away from it in order to devote his biography to self-education and poetry. However, his first adult poetry appeared only closer to the age of 40. Many enlightened people appeared among Abai's acquaintances, he willingly communicated with N. Dolgopolov, Gross, E. Michaelis.
                         <br><br>
                         Reading became another addiction of Abai, he loved Lermontov, Pushkin, Byron, Goethe, Krylov. He read the works of the great European classics in translation into Russian, thanks to which he gradually enlightened and developed, learned to subtly feel the beautiful.
                         <br><br>
                         The adolescent years of the poet's life were filled with learning. At this time, Abay sought to comprehend the art of oratory, as well as learn more about the customs and rules by which his people lived. He listened from storytellers, akyns, folk poetry. Thus, he began to compose his own poems, adopting their experience and skills.
                         The first poetic lines, including the first of the masterpieces called “Summer is a sunny time”, he published not under his own name, but under the name of his friend, Kokbai Zhanatayuly, in 1889 in the newspaper “Dala ualayaty”. After that, he paid a ransom to a friend and returned his own name to his work.

                    <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-right: 10px;">Only at the age of 40 did the poet begin to create his first serious poems and poems. Abai's translation activity has spread as widely as the composition of lyrics. He also wrote poems in which love themes prevailed. There were both realistic images and elements of magic in his poems (“Azim's Story”, “Masgut”).
                        <br><br>
                         In addition, other poets used the plot of his work "Eskendir" in their work.
                         <br><br>
                         In total, Abay created more than 170 poems, some of them were borrowed by Russian poets, in particular, Lermontov remade his work “Mountains slumber in the silence of the night” into Russian (“Mountain peaks sleep in the darkness of the night”). Abai was engaged in translations of the works of Russian and European poets, thus acquainting his people with their heritage.
                         <br><br>
                         He introduced new rhymes, poem sizes into Kazakh literature, and also created several dozen melodies that have retained their popularity to this day. Its historical significance is great for the Kazakh nation, outstanding works are also revered by contemporaries. Abai gathered around him many talented students, among them were his sons and relatives. When creating works, he did not write them down, so many have not been preserved.</p>

                          <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 30px;"> More than 20 films have been made based on the writer's works. The first film based on Chingiz Aitmatov was the film "Pass", filmed in 1961 by director Alexei Sakharov. In 1965, the story "The First Teacher" was filmed by director Andrei Konchalovsky at Mosfilm, the story "Camel's Eye" became the basis of Larisa Shepitko's debut film "Heat" (1962) with Bolotbek Shamshiev in the title role, who later became one of the best directors for staging films based on the works of Chingiz Aitmatov: "Echo of Love" (1974), "White Steamboat" (1975), "Early Cranes" (1979), "Climbing Mount Fuji" (1988). <br><br>
                           They appeared when the poet had already crossed the line of maturity, when more than half of his life had already been lived, when he knew the worldview of his own people. The author did not try to "reinvent the wheel", he simply put together the usual rules regarding morality and norms of behavior in society. </p>

                      But now the “Words” seem to be something ordinary, but in those years they were received with enthusiasm. Understandable to everyone, because they are presented in a simple language, they gained popularity among ordinary Kazakhs. They contributed to the formation of high morality and enlightenment among the local population.
                      <br><br>
                      "Kara soz" was translated into Russian several times. The books were published in large numbers in 1945, 1954 and 1979. Attempts were made to publish the book in German, but in the translation of the "Words" they lost their artistic value, so the work remained unfinished. <br><br>
                      The literary heritage of Abay is popular in his homeland. In Kazakhstan, they even introduced a subject called “Aba studies”, in which his works are studied in order to search for a hidden meaning.
                     The first collection, called "Poems of the Kazakh poet Ibragim Kunanbayev" appeared in 1909. In 1922 it was republished again - immediately in Kazan, then in Tashkent.
                      <br><br>
                      Then other works of the author, which are produced to this day, saw the light. In 1940, the book "Lyrics and Poems" was published, five years later "Favorites". Books were published in two languages - Kazakh and Russian.

              <p class="col text-secondary" style="font-size: 14px; padding-right: 10px;"> Abai had 3 wives: Dilda, Aigerim and Yerkezhan, because polygamy was allowed at that time. The first two bore him 10 children, 9 of whom took part in the Great Patriotic War.<br><br>
                  Of these, the poet especially singled out the sons of Alykbay, Magauy and Abdirakhman, to whom his talent was transferred. Unfortunately, the last two died of illness at a young age.
                  <br><br>
                  The loss of his sons crippled Abai's health. He died on June 23 (July 6), 1904 at the age of 58. Studying a brief biography of Abai Kunanbaev, one can understand that the poet not only made a great contribution to the development of literature and culture in his country, but also touched Russian culture.
